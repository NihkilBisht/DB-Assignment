Answer 1 : Product table represents a table storing information about individual products.Product_Category table represents a table storing information about different categories of products.
The "Product" entity has a foreign key column named_ CategoryID that refers to the primary key column ID in the "Product_Category" entity.This establishes a link between the two entities, indicating that each product in the "Product" entity is associated with a specific category defined in the "Product_Category" entity.


Answer 2 : In order to  ensure that each product in the product table has a valid category assigned to it, we can use a foreign key constraint. The foreign key constraint will ensure that the value in the CategoryID column of the Product table corresponds to a valid CategoryID in the Product table. This helps maintain referential integrity in our database. For example,

CREATE TABLE Product_Category (
    CategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Description VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Product (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    CategoryID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES Product_Category(CategoryID)
);

In the above example,the Product_Category table is created with a primary key CategoryID.The Product table is created with a foreign key constraint on the CategoryID column, referencing the CategoryID column in the ProductCategory table.This foreign key constraint ensures that any value entered in the CategoryID column of the Product table must already exist in the CategoryID column of the Product_Category table. If we try to insert a product with an invalid category, the database will raise a foreign key violation error.When inserting or updating records in the Product table, we will need to make sure to provide valid category IDs that exist in the Product_Category table to maintain the integrity of the relationship between the two tables.
